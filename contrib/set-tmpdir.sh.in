# set-tmpdir: Set TMPDIR environment variable.
#
# On macOS, after switching to another user ID on the command line -
# e.g., via su(1) or sudo(1), attempting to run emacsclient(1) may
# fail with error such as "Connection refused". This can be caused by
# the environment variable TMPDIR not being defined. In particular,
# TMPDIR must be set prior to running emacs(1) in daemon mode.
# To set TMPDIR, source the contents of this file:
#
#   source /path/to/set-tmpdir.sh
#
# To automate this, add the contents of this file to every user's
# shell init script - e.g., ~/.bashrc. Then run su(1) or sudo(1) so
# that the target user's login is set. For example, for bash(1) and
# sudo(1), you could do this via a shell function, sume:
#
#   sume () { sudo -i -u "${1:-root}" /usr/bin/env bash; }
#
#
