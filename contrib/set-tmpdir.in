# set-tmpdir: Set TMPDIR environment variable.
#
# On macOS, after switching to another user ID on the command line -
# e.g., via su(1) or sudo(1), attempting to run emacsclient(1) may
# fail with error such as "Connection refused". This can be caused by
# the environment variable TMPDIR not being defined. In particular,
# TMPDIR must be set prior to running emacs(1) in daemon mode.
# To set TMPDIR, source the contents of this file:
#
#   source /path/to/set-tmpdir
#
: ${GETCONF_CMD:='@GETCONF_CMD@'}
