Q: Why am I getting "WARNING: 'automake-1.15' is missing on your system."?
A: git(1) does not preserve timestamps, so autoconf(1) is trying to
   rebuild aclocal.m4 and friends. To prevent this, run touch(1):

      $ touch configure.ac aclocal.m4 configure Makefile.am Makefile.in
      $ ./configure
      $ make && sudo make install

Q: Why doesn't GNUPG passphrase prompt in terminal work (e.g., Magit mode
   attempting to sign a GIT commit)?
A: Emacs can become detached from the terminal, especially in a graphical
   environment. A better solution is provided by Emacs after version 25.1,
   which can prompt for a passphrase in the minibuffer.

   To enable this, install pinentry version 0.9.5 or later, enable
   loopback mode in gpg-agent by adding two lines to
   ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf:

allow-emacs-pinentry
allow-loopback-pinentry

   reload gpg-agent:

$ gpgconf --reload gpg-agent

   then add two lines to ~/.emacs:

(setq epa-pinentry-mode 'loopback)
(pinentry-start)

   and restart Emacs. Finally, thank Oliver Scholz for providing
   this answer at:
