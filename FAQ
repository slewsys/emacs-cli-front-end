Q: Why am I getting "WARNING: 'automake-1.15' is missing on your system."?
A: git(1) does not preserve timestamps, so autoconf(1) is trying to
   rebuild aclocal.m4 and friends.  To prevent this, run touch(1):

      $ touch configure.ac aclocal.m4 configure Makefile.am Makefile.in
      $ ./configure
      $ make && sudo make install
